## Nertz Scoring Rules

The app is designed for the standard Nertz scoring system:
- **Winning a round**: +1 point per card in your Nertz pile
- **Losing a round**: -1 point per card remaining in your hand
- **Typical range**: -26 to +52 points per round
- **Game length**: Variable, typically first to 100 points wins

## Customization

### Changing Winning Score
- Set any winning score from 50 to 500 points
- Default is 100 points
- Can be changed before starting a new game

### Adding More Icons
To add more icons, edit the `icons` array in `script.js`:
```javascript
const icons = [
    'fas fa-user', 'fas fa-star', 'fas fa-heart',
    // Add more Font Awesome icon classes here
];
```

### Styling Customization
All styling is in `styles.css` with CSS custom properties for easy theming:
- Color schemes can be modified in the CSS variables
- Responsive breakpoints can be adjusted
- Animations and transitions can be customized

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Scores not saving**: Check that all scores are between -26 and 52
2. **Players not appearing**: Ensure player name is entered and icon is selected
